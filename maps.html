	<p>In a September report released by the New York City's Comptroller Scott Stringer, it was revealed that there are currently 27,560 square feet of vacant storefronts in Astoria, a nine-year high. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The culprit, according to Constantinides, is predatory developers who have, as Stringer report demonstrates, driven up retail rent by 39% over the last year from $29.91 a square foot on average to $41.66. The report also notes that property tax on retail space in the area has also climbed, going up by 69% between  2017-2018, creating a greater burden for mom and pop shops. 
	</p>
	<p>
	"Change is the one constant in New York City - and sometimes, change can be overwhelming,"" said Stringer in a statement. "Even as our economy has grown, many mom-and-pop stores have been left behind, transforming spaces once owned by local small businesses into barren storefronts.""
</p>
	<p>Both Stringer and Constantinides agree that whatâ€™s most important about this report is that it can help the city move in a direction that supports small businesses, as retail trends continue to change, in New York City and for Constantinides, in his Queens neighborhood of Astoria.
	</p>
	<p>A fear echoed among residents like Heather Job, 26, is of big box stores moving into Astoria and further exacerbating retail vacancy in the area, specifically, a Target invasion. Target is currently hoping to build a 47,000 square feet store on 31st in the Ditmars area of Astoria.
	</p>
	<p>"I don't want a Target in my neighborhood," said Job, who chose Astoria when moving to the city from Colorado due to its small-town charm. "I don't want it raising my rent."
